# Lab 2 - Be the Compiler


Be the Compiler

Each of the Java files on the problem represents a complete source file. Your job is to play compiler and determine whether each of these files will compile. If they compile, please write the output yourself (without using a real compiler, you are the compiler now), If they won't compile, explain how would you fix them, explain why, and then write the output yourself after you fix them.

Please type your answers in the text entry box, or upload a file (e.g. word, pdf).

A.
```java
class Exercise2a{

        public static void main (String[] args) {

                int 1num = 1;

                int 2num = 2;

                System.out.println("The sum of these two is: " + (1num + 2num));

        }

}
```

B.
```JAVA
class Exercise2b{

        int x = 5;

        int y = 6;

        System.out.println("The sum of these two is: " + (x + y));

}
```

 

C.
```JAVA
class Exercise2c{

        public static void main (String[] args) {

                int numOne == 1;

                int numTwo == 2;

                System.out.println("The sum of these two is: " + (numOne + numTwo));

        }

}
```

 

D.
```JAVA
class Exercise2d{

        public static void main(String[] args) {

                int x = 4;

                int y = 5.6;

                System.out.print("The sum of these two is: ");

                System.out.print(x + y);

        }

}
